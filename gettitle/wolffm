    The first line represents the line (or the first part of the line) that
    *uniquely* identifies the section of the webpage where the title is stored
    (from now on called "identifier").

    The second line means how many lines to skip, after the identifier, to
    find the title. "1" means that the title is on the line immediately
    following the identifier.

    The third (optional) line is the rexx code (maybe) needed to clean-up the
    title from extraneous characters, like HTML tags and the like. This must
    be on one line (but you can use semicolons to separate multiple statements)
    and the actual title read from the web page is in the "TheTitle" variable.
    It must follow the rules for the "interpret" statement in rexx (see the
    rexx reference for more infos). If you don't want or need this line,
    simply leave it empty.

    Subsequent lines are not read at all, so you can write what you want here.
