Installing Cris Widgets v0.8
============================

Installation is very simple now that we have an real installer ;-)

Simply unzip the archive (if you use PKZIP remember to let it create
directories!) into a temporary directory. 

Then run "cwinst.cmd" and follow the directions. The installer will autodetect
all the values that it can, and will ask for those it can't.

The installer will customize ALL the widgets for you, even if you don't want
to install them all. You can reply with bogus answers if you feel so (e.g. if
you don't have Z! installed, and you don't want to install the Z! widgets,
simply reply with a fictitious directory, and tell the installer not to copy
files).

At the end, the installer will open two folders: one with documentation, and
another with the customized widgets. Simply ctr+drag (that is: hold down the
CTRL key while dragging) the widgets on an empty spot on the XCenter, and 
you're done. You'll probably want to keep the "Z! Controller" and the 
"Z! Monitor" together.

Once done, you can safely delete the temporary directory. You may want to copy
the documentation files somewhere, BTW.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: (for those with older versions of XWP)

If you don't have XWP 0.9.14 you won't be able to drag the widgets to the
XCenter. You'll have to use the old "manual" installation. That is, you'll
have to edit the files to enter your preferences, then install a few rexx 
buttons and rexx gauges, and finally manually copy the code in those widgets.

The files to be customized are found in the "obsolete" directory. You have to
customize the gettitle.cmd script also.

BTW, you may want to run the install program anyway, because it will copy 
the needed support files (icons, etc) to their directories, and will report 
autodetected values for your convenience. If you run it, it will customize
the gettitle.cmd script for you.

Here is a little reference for the creation of widgets:

Z! Controller:		install a rexx button (2 rexx buttons for the "wider" setup)
Z! Monitor:			install a rexx gauge
Swap Monitor:		install a rexx gauge
Clock:				install a rexx gauge

The default icon(s) for the Z! Controller must be located in the
\XWorkplace\plugins\XCenter directory.
