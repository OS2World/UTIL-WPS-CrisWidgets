Cris' Widgets History of changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Version 0.8
===========

. This release only fixes two small bugs in the installation program.
  There has never been a public release of version 0.7.


Version 0.7
===========

. Finally we have an INSTALLER!! You don't have to manually enter the code
  any more (unless you have an old release of XWP).

. Updated the "wider" setup for the Z! Controller widget. Now it is at the
  same level as the main code.
  
. Enhanced parser for internet radio stations: now correctly separates title
  from author (if possible).
  
. Z! Controller now automatically retrieves titles for internet radio stations
  that don't report them (but you still have to write setups for your preferred
  radio stations... WolfFM and RadioParadise are given as examples).
  
. New directive in the setup for internet radio stations: now you can add code
  to parse the returned title to remove garbage etc. See the setup for Radio
  Paradise for an example.

. Cliff Brady contributed (again! Thnx Cliff) a new method of querying titles
  via the RxSocks library. This method is more integrated, does not require
  external tools like WGet, and uses less CPU and memory. BTW, I'm not able
  to use it because I am behind a firewall and need to go through a proxy.
  If anyone knows how to go through a proxy using RxSocks, I will be VERY glad
  to hear from you (and if you can code some rexx... ;-)).
  The installer asks you which method do you want to use.

. Reworked the ReadMe file. Removed most obsolete/redundant information. If
  you want to know about new features and bug fixes, look though this file from
  now on.

. Redesigned icons for the PM123 and CDPlay widgets.

. Visual separator between the time area and the title area. Now Z! Monitor is
  even nicer than before! ;-)
  
. Z! Monitor now displays a visual indicator when it is retrieving titles from
  the web rather than directly from the stream (a small leftwards arrow next
  to the title).
  
. Nicer display of playing time (formatted).


Version 0.6
===========

. Thanx to some ideas and code from Sushenjit Bandyopadhyay, Z! widgets have
  been updated again. Thankyou Sushenjit!
  Also two new widgets have been provided by Cliff Brady. Thankyou Cliff!

. Fixed a bug when streaming that crashed Z! Monitor

. Time gauge is now always 100% full when streaming from the Internet

. When playing time > 59m, it displays hours:minutes (again useful when 
  streaming from the Internet)
  
. Now starts Z! when something is dropped on the controller
  (contributed by S.B.)

. Now you can drop directories, playlists and MP3s on the controller
  (everything that is not a directory or an MP3 file will be considered
  a playlist) (partly contributed by S.B.)
  
. On directory drop, the widget will scan the directory and all 
  subdirectories recursively and add to the playlist all the MP3s it 
  can find (partly contributed by S.B.)

. New function for internet radio stations that don't return the song title: if
  the widget finds a file called "force-title.txt" in Z!'s directory, it will
  read the first line and use it instead of the title returned from Z!
  I'm providing a script and two sample configs for "Radio Paradise" and
  "WolfFM". The script uses wget to retrieve the home page and then scans it 
  to retrieve the current song title. Look in the "zctrl\scripts" subdirectory.
  A minor glitch is that, since titles are updated in real-time, you'll get
  the title of the next song before you actually hear it. The bigger your
  buffer is, the longer will be the delay.
  
. Added CDPlay controller widget (contributed by Cliff Brady)

. Added PM123 controller widget (contributed by Cliff Brady)


Version 0.5
===========

. Thanx to some code and ideas from Martin Lafaix, Z! widgets have been
  greatly enhanced!! Thankyou Martin! 
  
  See below for some great news:
  
. Z! Monitor shows the running time beneith the title

. Z! Monitor shows a progress-bar indicating the percentage of the song

. Updated Z! Monitor's tooltip to show song title, album, author, total playing
  time
  
. Z! Controller will start Z! if not running when a file is dropped on it

. Updated Z! Monitor's strings when Z! is not running or not playing to be more
  informative
  
. Z! Controller shows volume level in its tooltip (*)

. Z! Controller shows volume level as a red bar in its icon (*)

(*) These features require an updated release of Z!, that may still not be
    available at present time (see http://dink.org).


Version 0.4
===========

. Added Z! Controller Monitor.

. Corrected a bug in Z! Controller: when dropping a playlist it did not start
  playing.

. Added an alternative wider setup for the main Z! Controller widget.

. Corrected percentage calculation in Swap Monitor.

. Swap Monitor now changes barchart color when swap grows.


Version 0.3 and previous
========================

. Who knows? I don't remember anymore... :-)
