GetTitle script ReadMe
======================

Purpose
^^^^^^^
This is a rexx script used by the Z! Monitor widget to retrieve the
title of the current song for those internet radio stations that don't
return the song title embedded in the stream.

I don't know exactly why they do it... I once thought it was some kind of
technical limitation, but now I've seen that there are radio stations which
actually return the title (e.g. www.mostlyclassical.com).

BTW, rather than keeping my browser open, I've developed this small script
that will parse a home page and extract the title, and then feed it to the 
widget.


Setup
^^^^^
Setup is easy, you just need to look at the HTML code of the page which lists
the current song. To get you started, two examples are given: for RadioParadise
and for WolfFM.

The name of the setup file is derived from the URL of the radio's home page
(e.g. radioparadise for www.radioparadise.com, and wolffm for www.wolffm.com).
Look at the examples for more infos.


Final words
^^^^^^^^^^^
I hope you'll enjoy it.

If you write more setups for other radio stations, please send them to me and
I'll include them in the distribution.
